# Questions
- A3.1.4.fit4+: How to do orthogonal polynomials? Which algorithm is used in R and how can it be reproduced in Python (with numpy, preferably)? My model has similar metrics and other coefficients, so my guess is that I failed to put the constant coefficients for the orthogonal polynomial terms.
